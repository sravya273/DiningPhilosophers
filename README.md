Dining Philosophers Problem using P Threads and semaphores in C  
The dining philosophers problem is another classic synchronization problem which is used to evaluate situations where there is a need of 
allocating multiple resources to multiple processes.  
#Problem Statement  
Consider there are five philosophers sitting around a circular dining table. The dining table has five chopsticks and a 
bowl of rice in the middle  
#Solution  
From the problem statement, it is clear that a philosopher can think for an indefinite amount of time. But when a philosopher starts eating, 
he has to stop at some point of time. The philosopher is in an endless cycle of thinking,hungry,eating.  
The code is an implementation with P Threads and Semaphores in C
